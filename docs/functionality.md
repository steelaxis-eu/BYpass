# BeautyPass: Project Functionality

BeautyPass is a specialized platform designed for aesthetic professionals (masters) to manage client compliance, safety protocols, and procedure documentation with precision and elegance.

## What (Functionality Overview)

The platform provides a "Sanctuary of Aesthetic Compliance" with the following core features:

- **Digital Waivers & Consent**: Legally robust digital forms that clients can sign artistically on-site, ensuring all safety and regulatory requirements are met before a procedure begins.
- **Technical Cards & Ritual Documentation**: A centralized place for masters to record precise details of every procedure, including:
    - Pigment batches and colors used.
    - Needle depths and types.
    - Specific technique notes.
- **Secure Client Archiving**: A secure digital vault for client data, signatures, and procedure history, replacing physical folders with bank-level digital security.
- **Role-Based Dashboards**:
    - **Admin**: Manage the "Sanctuary" and invite new Masters.
    - **Master**: Manage procedures, technical cards, and client signatures.

## Why (Rationale)

- **Safety & Compliance**: Bridges the gap between aesthetic art and clinical science by ensuring safety is managed with untouchable precision.
- **Professional Standard**: Elevates the practice of aesthetic masters by providing a premium foundation of trust and respect for the client.
- **Efficiency**: Streamlines the intake and documentation process, allowing artists to focus on their "canvas" rather than paperwork.
- **Legacy of Protection**: Creates a permanent, searchable bond of trust through digital records that protect both the master and the client.

## How to Improve

To further elevate BeautyPass, the following enhancements are suggested:

- **Client-Facing Mobile App**: Allow clients to pre-fill waivers and track their healing process/aftercare directly from their phones.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Provide masters with insights into pigment performance and client return rates.
- **AI-Powered Image Documentation**: Integrate automatic skin tone analysis or procedure result tracking using high-fidelity image processing.
- **Enhanced Internationalization**: Expand beyond Latvian/English to support a global community of aesthetic artists.
- **Automated Reminders**: Integrated SMS/Email reminders for touch-ups or follow-up consultations.
